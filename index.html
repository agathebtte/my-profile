          Hello, I'm Agathe! I'm 18 years old. I come from Reims, a city in the north of France. Now I live in Cergy-Pontoise for my studies at ESSEC Business School. I love animals, travelling, my friends, and also my family.

        <h2>Animals</h2>
        <p>
          I have loved animals since I was a child. Indeed, I had 2 cats named "Noisette" and "Rosalie", as well as a rabbit named "Chipie" but who was very stupid. I have also been riding for 15 years, both with my school and with my friends. I had a horse for 2 years called "Saga". Now, with my family we have moved to the country, to a village called "Barby" and have a big garden. We have chickens, two donkeys, two tortoises, 4 dogs and geese.

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>
          I love to travel, especially to sunny countries. I find that it allows me to escape from everyday life, to meet new people, to discover new cultures, new languages, new landscapes... I have already been to London, Prague, Berlin, the Canary Islands, Mykonos, the Balearics... But above all, I did a university exchange at the age of 15 in Los Angeles. Indeed, I went alone with my best friend for 3 weeks in a campus to improve my English, but also to visit the city. My next destination is Mexico: I'm going to Cancun in August with my family.

        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <p>
          I spend a lot of time with my friends, I love going on holiday with them, doing activities, going for a drink. I had a great time meeting new people at ESSEC, which helped me to adapt to my new environment. Indeed, I think that the people around us play a key role in our development and happiness.
